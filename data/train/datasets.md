this part is the structure for datasets
===

the dataset can be download from [here](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/index.html)<br>
for basic train I use the Range of Motion / 171204_pose1.<br>
I put the hd-image into train/image/(index of hd camera)/, and the camera information into train/camera/(index of hd camera)/<br>
And the json of positions into train/json_body (the number of image should be same as the number of json_body)
